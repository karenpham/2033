				<h2>The world of 2018 is not the same world</h2>
				<p class="info-sub">It was at the turn of the millennium. </p>
				<div class="about-description">
					<p>It is full of turbulence, uncertainty, and "disruption" of sorts in nearly every aspect of life. Artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, drones, synthetic biology, cryptocurrencies and Big Tech’s monopoly on data. But in many ways, <a href="#" title="the Lindy Effect persists">the Lindy Effect persists</a>, and the old remains resilient and the default. We are still far away from having teleporters, interstellar travel, and fusion energy. We don't even have flying cars which we're overdue for by a couple decades, and there is an ever widening gap between the haves and have-nots.</p>
					<p>Yet peering into the future, we see a bright horizon filled with hope - a world where technology will democratize knowledge, goods and services all along the socioeconomic ladder; where some of the deepest questions since the dawn of humanity will finally be answered; and where the quality of life in the poorest countries then will be better than the richest</p>

				<h2>We see 2033 as not just any year.</h2>
				<p class="info-sub">It represents an era that’ll be marked by momentous achievements,</p>
				<div class="about-description">
					<p>As we look forward, we think of 2033, and even though it could just as well be 2032 or 2034, we see 2033 as not just any year. It represents an era that’ll be marked by momentous achievements, of a scale and significance that has hitherto been unimaginable. </p>
					<p>The first human colony will be established on Mars. Advances in biotechnology enabled by artificial intelligence will have found treatments to diseases we didn't think would be treatable in the near future. More electric vehicles will be on the road than fossil fuel cars. Bioengineered food that is cleaner, healthier, and tastier than anything you've ever eaten will become mainstream, dramatically reducing the carbon footprint of the livestock industry. Space travel will be affordable to millions of people.</p>
					<h3>All this is expected to happen by 2033.</h3>
					<p>Christy and I love reading and dreaming about the future. This site is very much our ever-evolving personal collection of musings about this.</p>

				<h2>Products From the Future</h2>
				<div class="about-description">
					<p>Also, through our work with various scientists, entrepreneurs, inventors, and investors throughout the world who have been a part of building the future, we’ve been able to get first access to products we think are so wondrous they must be from the future. We’d like to share these with you here as well so occasionally you’ll be able to buy these products on this site. Each and every one of these products are based on breakthrough science pioneered by some of the best minds we’ve encountered.</p>
