					<h2>What is tru niagen™</h2>
					<h3>Niagen® and nad+</h3>
					<p>NIAGEN® is a specific form of vitamin B3 proven to significantly increase NAD+ levels. NAD+ is as essential to our cells as food, water or oxygen, so higher NAD+ levels can help support better overall health as we age.</p>
					<h3>The benefits</h3>
					<p>Our cells need NAD+ to regulate circadian rhythm, support cognitive function, and increase energy production at the cellular level. Here’s what increased NAD+ levels could mean for you:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>- Cognitive function support.</em></li>
						<li><em>- Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels already within a normal range.</em></li>
						<li><em>- Increased cellular metabolism and energy production.</em></li>
						<li><em>- Supported liver function, especially after stress.</em></li>
						<li><em>- Staying healthy, longer.</em></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tru niagen™</h3>
					<p>ChromaDex Inc. is the worldwide patent-holder of NIAGEN® (nicotinamide riboside) and makes NIAGEN® available directly to consumers under the brand name TRU NIAGEN™.</p>
